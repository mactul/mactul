## About me

I am a French student at the Telecom Physique Strasbourg engineering school. I started programming in 2015 and during these years, I learned python, C, basic-casio, html, css, js, php, sql, processing and even brainfuck. Today, I stopped trying to master many languages, I prefer to focus on C, which allows me to do almost everything, with unbeatable performance.

## My current opensource projects:

I am currently working on an antivirus for discord. This program works only in a statistical way, it evaluates the rate of correspondence between the files to be analyzed and a base of rogue files. The interest of this antivirus does not lie in its capacity to discriminate precisely viruses from other files, in reality it gives as many false positives as false negatives, but by giving the probability that a file is a virus, it allows its users to be much more vigilant. Coupled with a more classic antivirus, it should allow to fight effectively against token grabbers.

This project led me to develop 2 other main ones.

The first one is a simple TCP/TLS sockets overlay, which allows me to easily make encrypted sockets in ssl or not, compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac.  This library is going to receive some improvements, but I think we can already consider it as stable.

The second one uses the first one, it is a library allowing to make http/https connections. This library is easier to use than libcurl, but above all it allows to download web pages with fixed size buffers, which is very useful when you don't want to load the whole file, potentially viral, on your disk or even on your ram. Thus, my antivirus downloads a small piece of the file, does its calculations on it, downloads the next small piece, and so on.  
This project is unfortunately not yet as stable as I would like it to be, but I'm getting close to something really usable.
