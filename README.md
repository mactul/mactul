## About me

I am a French student at the Telecom Physique Strasbourg engineering school. I started programming in 2015 and during these years, I learned python, C, basic-casio, html, css, js, php, sql, processing and even brainfuck. Today, I stopped trying to master many languages, I prefer to focus on C, which allows me to do almost everything, with unbeatable performance.

## My current opensource projects:

I am currently working on a tool named [PowerMake](https://github.com/mactul/powermake). It's a tool that aims to replace make or xmake in my projects.  
It's a cross-platform makefile utility that provides a ton of simplifications and automation during the build process while leaving full power to the makefile writter.

This project is in constant evolution but starts to be mature enough to be used in real applications. Check it out if you have a minute to loose ;)
